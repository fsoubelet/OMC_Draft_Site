# OMC Methods

!!! note
    Very long content about the physics and practice of OMC methods + paper references for each (K-mod, 3D kicks, N-BPM...).
    Each method should be a H2, see examples below.
    
## N-BPM

## K-Modulation

This section gives a brief overview over the K-Modulation method.
A more detailed description can be found [^1] and references therein.

Also available on this page is a [checklist](../procedures/kmod.md) for conducting K-Modulation measurements in the LHC.

You can further find a description of the [K-Modulation GUI](../guis/kmod/gui.md) used for LHC measurements, and the analysis is part of [`omc3`](../packages/omc3/getting_started.md).

K-Modulation is a complementary optics measurement method compared to the techniques usually used in the LHC, which rely upon turn-by-turn data from multiple BPMs.
Instead of exciting the beam with a kicker magnet, the gradient of a quadrupole is changed and the induced tune-change is recorded.
The average $\beta$-function in the modulated quadrupole is linked to the gradient-change $\Delta K$ and tune-change $\Delta Q_{x,y}$ via [^1]

$$
\beta_{x,y} = \pm 2 \Delta K^{-1}\Big[ cot(2 \pi Q_{x,y}) [ 1 - cos(2 \pi \Delta Q_{x,y}) ] + sin(2 \pi \Delta Q_{x,y}) \Big].
$$

If these measurements are conducted for two adjacent quadrupoles, the evolution of the $\beta$-function in-between can be then obtained[^2].
Here, the average $\beta$-function in the quadrupole is expressed in terms of the optics functions $\beta_0$,$\alpha_0$, and $\gamma_0$ at the end of the quadrupole.
Assuming a drift space between the quadrupoles, these coordinates can then be expressed in terms of the distance of the quadrupole end to the middle of the driftsection $L^*$, the minimum $\beta$-function in the drift $\beta^*$, and an offset with respect to the middle $w$.
The length $L^*$ is taken from the machine layout.
Using the two average $\beta$-functions in the quadrupoles, the other two variables $\beta^*$ and $w$ can then be obtained.
The $\beta$-function at other elements in the drift space can then be obtained via propagation.

Compared to other methods, it allows to infer a potential waist shift and it's direction, which is not possible using the turn-by-turn based methods.
However, the K-Modulation method is usually more time-intensive, and is only applicable with individually powered quadrupoles.
