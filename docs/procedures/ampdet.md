# Amplitude Detuning Measurements

(example only)
## Measurement

- [ ] <details class="nodeco"><summary>Correct Coupling</summary>
      <p>Kick at medium amplitude and wait for the result. 
      Then put the result into the coupling correction tool.
      </p></details>
- [ ] <details class="nodeco"><summary>Check Coupling</summary>
      <p>Just in case the previous step did not work. 
      If it really failed: Crawl under a table and cry. 
      You are a disgrace for the OMC-Team. Everyone can correct coupling. Duh.      
      </p></details>
- [ ] <details class="nodeco"><summary>Do some measurement</summary>
      <p>Do kicks, then do some more kicks
      and then even more kicks and when you think you  are done, 
      better kicks some more just for good measure.
      Let's just hope you won't be the one who has to analyse all these kicks...
      </p></details>
    - [ ] <details class="nodeco"><summary>This is a subtask</summary>
        <p>I don't actually have anything to say. 
        I just wanted to show that these also work.
        </p></details>
