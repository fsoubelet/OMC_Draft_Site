# Checklists

In this section there are multiple checklists for procedures, that can be used as guidance during measurements.
To mark a task as finished, just click on the checkbox next to it!

!!! warning "Non-Persistance"
    The checked-boxes stay checked only as long as you stay on that page!
    Any reload will reset the ticks.

!!! note "Log Your Work!"
    After performing measurements or tests in the CCC, remember to add an entry into the LogBook.
    It can be accessed through the [OP Webtools][op_webtools]{target=_blank .cern_login}.
