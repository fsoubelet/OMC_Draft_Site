# Checklists

In this section there are multiple checklists for procedures, that can be used as guidance during measurements.
To mark a task as finished, just click on the checkbox next to it!

!!! warning "Non-Persistance"
    The checked-boxes stay checked only as long as you stay on that page!
    Any reload will reset the ticks.

!!! note "Log Your Work!"
    After performing measurements or tests in the CCC, remember to add an entry into the LogBook.
    It can be accessed through the [OP Webtools][op_webtools]{target=_blank .cern_login}.

    Ideally, each measurement shift has at least two entries, one created at the start of the shift to outline the plan, and one summary entry at the end.
    A first entry for a shift may look like this:

    ```
    Short Title for shift (e.g. MD 1234 Measuring XYZ)

    Fill : Fill Nr. for the first beam used for measurements.
    Beam Process: Beamprocess used during measurement.
    If separate measurements are conducted for the different beams, note here which beam is used for what.

    Personnel: People joining either in person or remotely, operators and EIC.

    Plan: Quick outline of the steps to be performed and general goals.
    ```
    
    A potental summary entry at the end of a shift may look like this:

    ```
    Title

    Summary: Brief description of the steps taken and results.

    Follow up: Next steps to be taken offline.

    Problems: Note of problems encountered and potential solutions.
    ```
