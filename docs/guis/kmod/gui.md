# The Kmod GUI

The Kmod GUI provides functionality to perform [K-Modulation](../../omc_team/methods.md#k-modulation) either as a full IP trim or through an individual magnet circuit, in the form of a graphical interface.
It also has the ability to extract and analyze data from previous trims.

This site will guide you through the GUI's layout and functionality.
For starters, check out [the basics of running the GUI](../about.md).

Alternatively, a procedure for performing K-modulation in the CCC is described on [this page](../../procedures/kmod.md).
