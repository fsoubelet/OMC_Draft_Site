# Installation of an IDE
The easiest way to develop the GUI is using the modified [eclipse](#using-eclipse) versions provided by [Accsoft-Eclipse](accsoft_eclipse).
There is also an [installation guide available](accsoft_eclipse_wiki).

For people using pycharm it might make sense to use [Intellij IDEA](#using-intellij-idea), yet this comes with some disadvantages, 
as we do not know how to export a JAR (see also [release of GUI](releases.md))

As both IDEs require [CommonBuildNextGeneration (CBNG)](cbng_wiki) to resolve dependencies and make releases,
one should either run these from somewhere in the Technical Network (e.g. from the dev-server) or mount the required paths via sshfs as described [here]()
