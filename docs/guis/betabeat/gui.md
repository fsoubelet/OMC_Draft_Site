# The Beta-Beat GUI

The Beta-Beat GUI provides different functionalities separated in multiple views, in the form of a graphical interface.
The GUI can be ran locally, provided you have access to `afs`, but most importantly directly from the CERN Control Center.
This section provides a short overview for the main features.

The GUI provides several panels, each for a defined use and with a set of options and results:

- [The BPM Panel](bpm_panel.md) for loading measurements files, displaying data and launching analysis.
- [The Analysis Panel](analysis_panel.md) to display and manipulate the results of harmonic analysis on measurement data.
- [The Optics Panel](optics_panel.md) to compare computed optics to nominal models.
- [The Correction Panel](correction_panel.md) to display the computed necessary corrections to reach the nominal model.

This site will guide you through the GUI's layout and functionality.
