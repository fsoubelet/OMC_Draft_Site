## Run 3 MDs Ideas 

## optics related

  * 2 New ballistic optics flavors:
      * Telescopic for tune jitter measurements with enhanced arcs
      * Ballistic with large vertical dispersion 
 
   * Half integer tune

   * 60 degress arc cell phase advance for HE-LHC (or 1/3 HE-LHC)

   * Experience HL-LHC-like  injection optics with beta*=6m (pilots only). 

   * Look at 11 T flux jumps with TbT data, possibly using a new optics with enhanced beta functions

   * 2 possible experiments with TOTEM to understand the assymetry of the local dispersion in IR5:
      * Measurements with flat orbit, >60 bunches
      * Measurements with ballistic optics

   * non-90 degrees arc cell phase advance to ease correction of errors in the arcs (reduce the knob degeneracy of orbit bumps at sextupoles) 

## coupling related

   * Switching off MCS and main sextupoles in one arc to evaluate possible (systematic) vertical or H misalignment of dipoles by measuring coupling and beta-beating during the b3 decay.
    In a previous MD there was a quadratic coupling increase due to the orbit bump in the arc (maybe the one without MS, tbc).

   * Crazy MD for this, could be shifting the edge of some dipoles up to see change in coupling.
  
   * Tilting a triplet quadrupole to check validity of the tilt measurement (with and/or without beam)

## BPM related

   * Measure bad BPMs with low and high intensities to detect possible issues with the comparator (transistor).  
   Also swap connections between good and bad BPM to identified.

   * Have one BPM unplugged to detect its noise until next technical stop.
  
   * Momentum compaction factor from Qs versus Voltage

   * Snap-back with forced 3D oscillations (optics, chroma,...)'

   * Maybe not OMC: 24h pilot at top energy to use damped beam for BSRT resolution measurement;  

   * 0.5 um bunch from new injector chain?? Good for optics measurements, BSRT calibration etc.

## K-mod related

   * K-Modulation with Xing angle and OFB off for Leon's Xing angle reconstruction

   * Arc K-modulation
 
   * K-modulation in IR4  during the  energy ramp 

   * Reduce to one the DCCTs per circuit with pilot in the machine and ATS optics to see the impact of 2 DCCTs. 
     Michele Martino also proposes increasing in 1ppm the noise of the DCCTs in one or all dipole PCs to see impact on tune jitter.


## nonlinear related

   * Commissioning?: Measure amplitude detuning coming from CMS solenoid by having the on and off measurements

   * IR non-linear corrector offsets measurement
 
   * Emittance growth from octupoles and chroma

   * Amplitude detuning measurement versus crossing angle with b6 corrector on, for 5 crossing angles to evaluate performance of the technique for b6 correction. 

   * Amplitude dependent optics: Dedicated settings at injection as PoP (Thomas & Barbara), alternative techniques in parallel (K-modulation with decohered beams and amplitude dependent segment-by-segment)

   * IR2 non-linear correction -> Dedicated squeeze for IR2 to allow for good triplet characterizaton to shed light on b4

   * Amplitude detuning in ballistic optics

   * ADT for single kicks

   * b5 RDTs

   * Measurement and correction of a3 RDTs at injection for lifetime optimization (correcting with MSSX and MSS)

   * Reduce RF voltage to decrease synchrotron tune to limit the emittance blow-up during excitation with driven and natural tunes close to each other
